## IMPORTANT NOTES
- Never use Package for UI.
- Only use Package for Functionality.



# Learning

Welcome to my personal learning log. Every folder captures a new topic or experiment—organized, dated, and easy to revisit.

## How this repo is organized
- Each folder = one topic, course, or experiment
- Prefer small, focused notes and runnable examples over walls of text
- Keep a short recap in each folder's README to remember what was learned and what to try next

## My workflow
1) Create a new folder named with the topic and date (e.g., `docker-2025-01-05`)
2) Drop code snippets, notebooks, and a brief README with:
	- What I was trying to learn
	- Key takeaways and commands
	- Next questions to explore
3) Commit early with concise messages, then refine as I iterate

## What to track in each learning
- Quick summary of the session (1–3 bullet points)
- Useful commands or code samples with context
- Links to references, videos, or papers
- Follow-up tasks or open questions

## Progress at a glance
- [ ] Set up the first topic folder and add notes
- [ ] Add a cheat-sheet section for recurring commands
- [ ] Review and refactor learnings weekly

## Helpful commands
- `tree -L 2` — glance at the folder layout
- `git status` — see what's changed before committing
- `git log --oneline` — review progress over time
